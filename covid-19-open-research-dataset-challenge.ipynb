The key formulas for LDA are as follows:\n\nP(w | z, β): Probability of word w given topic z and vocabulary distribution β.\nP(z | d, θ): Probability of topic z given document d and topic distribution θ.\nP(β): Prior probability of the vocabulary distribution β.\nP(θ): Prior probability of the topic distribution θ.\nThese probabilities are used to compute the joint probability distribution over all the latent variables in the model, which is given by:\n\nP(w, z, θ, β | d) = P(w | z, β) * P(z | d, θ) * P(β) * P(θ)\n\nThe goal of inference in LDA is to compute the posterior distribution over the latent variables, given a set of observed documents. This involves computing the conditional probability distribution over the topics and word assignments for each word in each document, given the other words in the document and the parameters of the model. This can be done using techniques such as variational inference or Gibbs sampling.\n\nOverall, LDA provides a flexible and powerful framework for modeling the underlying topics and structure of large collections of text data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Create dictionary and corpus for LDA\ndictionary = gensim.corpora.Dictionary(data_words)\ncorpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(doc) for doc in data_words]\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T12:01:01.922949Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T12:01:01.923335Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T12:05:49.062544Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T12:01:01.923304Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T12:05:49.061384Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":15,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Compute TF-IDF scores\ntfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')\ntfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(metadata['abstract'])\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T12:05:49.066106Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T12:05:49.066447Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T12:09:13.834004Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T12:05:49.066421Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T12:09:13.832881Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Train LDA model\nnum_topics = 12\nlda_model = gensim.models.LdaMulticore(corpus=corpus,\n                                       id2word=dictionary,\n                                       num_topics=num_topics, \n                                       random_state=42,\n                                       passes=10,\n                                       workers=2)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T12:09:13.835335Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T12:09:13.835637Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T13:19:41.561831Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T12:09:13.835611Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T13:19:41.560419Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":17,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Print top topics and their associated words\nfor i, topic in lda_model.show_topics(num_topics=num_topics, formatted=False):\n    print('Topic {}: {}'.format(i, ', '.join([word for word, _ in topic])))\n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T13:19:41.563796Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T13:19:41.564186Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T13:19:41.632349Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T13:19:41.564152Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T13:19:41.631385Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Topic 0: with, were, that, food, this, from, used, high, study, water\nTopic 1: with, health, that, covid, their, pandemic, this, study, social, were\nTopic 2: that, cells, cell, with, immune, expression, response, infection, this, inflammatory\nTopic 3: with, patients, were, cancer, patient, after, treatment, this, case, surgery\nTopic 4: were, with, covid, study, from, between, results, during, among, risk\nTopic 5: covid, this, that, health, pandemic, have, public, from, disease, been\nTopic 6: patients, covid, with, disease, severe, respiratory, clinical, sars, infection, acute\nTopic 7: sars, that, with, virus, protein, viral, this, from, viruses, human\nTopic 8: model, data, that, this, based, with, using, models, from, used\nTopic 9: vaccine, vaccination, influenza, vaccines, sars, against, antibody, dose, infection, antibodies\nTopic 10: care, were, with, patients, health, clinical, studies, patient, this, healthcare\nTopic 11: sars, were, positive, with, samples, testing, detection, test, from, results\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Compute coherence score\ncoherence_model_lda = CoherenceModel(model=lda_model, texts=data_words, dictionary=dictionary, coherence='u_mass')\ncoherence_lda = coherence_model_lda.get_coherence()\nprint('Coherence Score:', coherence_lda)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-24T13:19:41.633767Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-24T13:19:41.634104Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-24T13:22:30.886401Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-06-24T13:19:41.634074Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-24T13:22:30.885113Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Coherence Score: 0.509997433570809\n","output_type":"stream"}]}]}
